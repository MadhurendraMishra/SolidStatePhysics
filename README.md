**Computation of Optical Properties of Gold Rectangular Nano-Prism using the DDSCAT Code**
This study was conducted as part of the internal assessment for the Solid State Physics course during the second year of undergraduate studies. The research investigated how the size and shape of gold rectangular nanoparticles affect their extinction, scattering, and absorption properties. Dimensions of the nanoparticles were systematically varied to generate data for the efficiency factors of absorption, scattering, and extinction.
